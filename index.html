        <p id="Demo">
        An incandescent light bulb, incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe is an electric light with a wire filament heated until it glows. <br>
        The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb with a vacuum or inert gas to protect the filament from oxidation. Current is supplied to the <br>
        filament by terminals or wires embedded in the glass. A bulb socket provides mechanical support and electrical connections.

    <button type="button" onclick='getElementById("Demo").innerHTML="Incandescent bulbs are much less efficient than other types of electric lighting,converting less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light.The remaining energy is lost as heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb for 120 V operation is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60 lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150 lm/W for some white LED lamps."' style="font: size 100px ;">More About Bulb</button>
